Do you want to do this?

`{{some-link click=(transition-to "test" 'arg-to-route')}}`

Then this addon is for you. This is a very simple addon that gives you access to a helper (`transition-to`).

## Requirements

Requires Ember `2.3.0+` ( we use `Ember.getOwner` API, which was introduced in 2.3.0 ).

#### Polyfill for getOwner:

if you don't have ember 2.3+ you can install a polyfill addon:
https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-getowner-polyfill

* `ember install ember-transition-helper`

## Running

* `ember server`
* Visit your app at http://localhost:4200.

## Running Tests

* `npm test` (Runs `ember try:testall` to test your addon against multiple Ember versions)
